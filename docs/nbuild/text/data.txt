data.convert_to_fastq(SRA_paths)

   Given a list of paths so SRA_paths that should have been downloaded
   using the run_wget function uses fastq-dump command line program
   through  subprocess to convert all SRA files to fastq files. Yeilds
   paths to the fastq files as it runs. Appends ‘’ for SRA in
   SRA_paths appends .fastq to the filenames.

data.download_accession(output_dir, entrez_email='eholleman@luc.edu', dtype='cdna')

   Use Biopython Entrez and SeqIO to first pull the transcriptome
   accession from genbank(nucleotide database) and then write the
   records in the SeqIO object to a fasta file which then can be
   passed into the  make_kalisto_index function. Returns the absolute
   path to the  accession fasta file as a string and the number of
   coding sequences  as an int both in a tuple.

   Download accession also works in another mode. By setting the dtype
   arg to  ‘genome’ it will download and return path to the complete
   genome of the  accession. Used for handing off to bowtie index
   maker.

data.get_paired_end_paths_as_lists(fastq_dirs)

   Given the output from convert_to_fastq (directories holding the
   newly converted paired end fastq files) returns as list of lists
   the paths to the individual fastq files so they can be passed into
   kallisto function.

data.get_paired_paths_outer_dir(fastq_dir)

data.run_wget(output_dir, urls=['https://sra-downloadb.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sos2/sra-pub-run-11/SRR5660030/SRR5660030.1', 'https://sra-downloadb.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sos2/sra-pub-run-11/SRR5660033/SRR5660033.1', 'https://sra-downloadb.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sos2/sra-pub-run-11/SRR5660044/SRR5660044.1', 'https://sra-downloadb.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sos2/sra-pub-run-11/SRR5660045/SRR5660045.1'])

   Given a list of valid urls (file locations) uses subprocess to run
   wget to download all files in that list of urls. Writes downloaded
   files to the given output_dir and names files based on the basename
   of the url (everything after the last /). Returns a list of
   absoulte paths to the downloaded files as a list.
